# 🚀 Resume Screening AI using NLP

An intelligent Resume Screening System that automatically ranks resumes based on job description matching using Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning techniques.

## 📌 Problem
Recruiters often receive hundreds of resumes for a single job opening. Manually reviewing each resume is slow, repetitive, and inefficient.

## ✅ Solution
This project automates the shortlisting process by:
- Extracting text from resumes (.docx)
- Cleaning and preprocessing resume data
- Converting text into numerical features using TF-IDF
- Calculating similarity using Cosine Similarity
- Ranking candidates based on match percentage
- Exporting shortlisted candidates to CSV

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. Place resumes inside the `Resumes/` folder  
2. Add job requirements in `JD.txt`  
3. Run the notebook  
4. Get ranked results in `shortlisted_candidates.csv`

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- NLP (TF-IDF, Cosine Similarity)
- python-docx

## 📊 Output
✔ Ranked candidate list  
✔ Match percentage score  
✔ Skills identified  
✔ CSV export for HR

## 🎯 Key Features
- Automated resume shortlisting
- Skill extraction
- Fast processing for 200+ resumes
- Simple and practical workflow
- Real-world HR use case

## 💡 Why This Project?
This project demonstrates how NLP and Machine Learning can solve real business problems by reducing manual effort and improving hiring efficiency. It showcases practical skills in text processing, feature engineering, similarity analysis, and automation.
